          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            Make the tour booking experience easier and  more enjoyable. Beside that, this app also contains other features for Visa service, chat room and process tracking. The interface should be easy to use and well-organized with large amount of content.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            By searching and collecting information about client’s business and trying other apps and website which have the similar business model. My team has came up with ideas and solutions that can enhance the product value. Next my team worked on wireframes before processing with visual design.

          <h3>Visual design</h3>
          <p>
            This mobile app featured material design as the design system. The
            app design was not only focused to the people who search for tour
            packages or articles but also to those who are always on the go.<br />
            The brand colors gave the contrast its needed between elements and i
            have gave specific role to each color in the interface, green for
            CTA and pink for emphasized content.<br />
            The button components have gradient background to stands out from
            the surface. Users can interact more comfortably while being outside
            with the objects that have depth.
